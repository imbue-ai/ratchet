# NB - Reference - Doc Types

Tags: #nb #reference

## Purpose

Quick reference for the hierarchy of types of documents supported today as well as where to find templates.

## Doc Types

Use one type per note:

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Hub | Landing page with links to sub-notes | `NB - Hub` |
| Guide | Procedural how-to steps, or onboarding info | `NB - Guide - Tagging` |
| Decision | Recorded architectural or process choice | `NB - Decision - Architecture` |
| Reference | Cheatsheet with quick reference to information or links | `NB - Reference - Common Commands` |
| Debug | Problem/cause/solution troubleshooting | `NB - Debug - Remote Set` |
| Worklog | Agent work session documentation | `Worklog - Agent 15 - Feature` |
| Worklog-Details | Sub-docs with detailed info on work session turns or topics | `Worklog-Details - Agent 15 - Feature` |
| Scratch | Temporary notes space | `Ideas - Scratch` |

### Naming Rules

1. **Title Case** - Capitalize major words in each segment
2. **Hyphen separators** - Use ` - ` between segments
3. **Slash for nesting** - Use `/` only within Topic segment: `Worktrees/Direnv - Debug - NB_DIR`
4. **No parentheses** - Encode scope in Topic or Specific segment, not in parentheses
5. **H1 is canonical** - The H1 heading determines display, not the filename
